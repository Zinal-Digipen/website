            <h2> What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
            <p>
                Network neutrality, often referred to as net neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally. This means that ISPs should offer users and online content providers consistent rates irrespective of content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication. In other words, whether a user connects to Netflix, Internet Archive, or a blog, their ISP must treat them all the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Net neutrality ensures that all data on the internet is treated equally by ISPs and governments, regardless of content, user, platform, application, or device. For users, net neutrality enables access and transparency of internet content and allows access to all internet services and applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of net neutrality argues that the internet should be accessible to everyone and requires all ISPs to provide the same level of data access and speed to all traffic. Traffic to one service or website cannot be blocked or degraded.

            <h2> Why is it Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Net neutrality is essential for the continued existence of a free and open internet. It directly affects anyone who uses the internet, as it deals with the type of content they can access and the ways they can be charged for their internet use. It helps to provide freedom of information exchange, promotes competition and innovation for Internet services, and upholds standardization of Internet data transmission which was essential for its growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Net neutrality protects the people's right to communicate, create, view, and browse freely on the internet across many different platforms and many different browsers. It protects our freedom of speech and gives more access for people to create and share ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the internet is part of everyone’s daily lives and all aspects of the economy, net neutrality ensures that the public decides what content we read, websites we visit, and what services we use online—and not private ISP companies.

            <h2> The Threat to Net Neutrality</h2>
            <p>
                The threats to net neutrality are numerous and significant. They include the potential for ISPs to block or censor content, slow down data transmission, and create fast lanes that favor larger websites. These practices could lead to a two-tier internet, with a fast lane for those willing to pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another threat is the reduction of investment, deterrence of competition, increase in taxes, imposition of unnecessary regulations, and prevention of the Internet from being accessible to poor people. There is also the risk of Internet traffic not being allocated to the most needed users, and the fact that large ISPs already have a performance advantage over smaller providers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real danger to the Internet ecosystem in the U.S. is the lack of competition at the broadband provider level. This lack of competition allows ISPs to dictate terms and conditions that may not be in the best interest of the consumers or the principles of net neutrality.
