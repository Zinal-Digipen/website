</p><h1 align="CENTER">Student &amp; Graduate Web Pages</h1>

This is currently the most popular area of our web site!  Many of DigiPen's students 
have created their own home pages to tell you a little
about their backgrounds, career goals and to even show you some of their work. 
This area will be undergoing several updates over the next month due to the
new students starting at DigiPen in September.  
<p>
A new addition to this area will be web pages made by graduates of the school with contact 
information.
</p><p>
Please note that some of the student home pages are extremely graphics intensive 
so be prepared for longer downloading times.  
</p><p>
<strong>If you already have a link to any of the 
students' home pages, you will have to change the URL as this area has been reorganized.</strong>
